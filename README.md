# Flutter Animations

## Implicit Animations:
> With implicit animations, you can animate a widget property by setting a target value; whenever that target value changes, the widget animates the property from the old value to the new one. In this way, implicit animations trade control for convenience—they manage animation effects so that you don’t have to.

- Easy to use but less control.
- Target value derives the animation.
